I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Dr. Sayan Ranu, who has been a mentor and a friend. His support and guidance have been priceless. A special thanks to Jithin Vachery for sharing his knowledge and expertise. Many of the ideas described in this thesis would not have been possible without the many constructive and valuable discussions I had with the both of them.

I would like to thank all the remarkable professors in the Computer Science Department for their constant encouragement. A notable mention to all my friends for the wonderful memories over the course of the past five years here at the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras. In particular, Dheepikaa and Sahitya for being ideal project partners over the years, Venkat, Sudheer, Aahlaad, Dhanvin and Rajan for being the best hostel-mates and Arun and Chinmay, who were indirectly responsible for me shifting major to Computer Science. Lastly I would like to thank my most awesome mother, Soma, my always inspiring brother, Pratik and my twin sister, Abhilasha, who has been my guiding source of light.
