%In this work we were able to show the effectiveness of M-tree based approach on non-binary feature vectors. Though we could achieve up to 2-fold improvement in query time, we would want to improve this further by doing further analysis.We also were able to effectively exploit the sparsity in data to construct the inverted index, which had given up to 100-fold improvement in query time.The current work has opened up many more avenues for us to explore. We shall be looking into the following areas:\\
