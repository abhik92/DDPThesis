Chem-informatics is a field dealing with chemistry and information science, with the primary motivation being the use of data mining, information retrieval and machine learning techniques to make predictions and inferences which can later be verified experimentally. The datasets used in this field are generally information regarding molecules and their structure. One such representation is in the form of "Chemical Fingerprints", which are primarily feature vectors .In this work we are concerned with indexing methods of such datasets of chemical compounds. We propose two techniques for the same : M-tree based technique and Inverted index based technique for performing range, point and top-k queries. We go on to study the effectiveness of these techniques through various experiments.
